            <p>
                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
                These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, 
                primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, which produces heat-trapping gases.

            <h2>Hotter temperatures</h2> <br>
            <p>Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 
                2020 was one of the hottest years on record. 
                Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around. 
                Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.</p><br>
            
            <h2>More severe storms</h2> <br>
            <p>Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more severe and frequent storms.
                They cause flooding and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of dollars.</p><br>

            <h2>Increased drought</h2> <br>
            <p>The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. 
                This melts ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island communities. 
                The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from the atmosphere. 
                More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which endangers marine life.</p><br>

            <h2>A warming, rising ocean</h2> <br>
            <p>Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 
                2020 was one of the hottest years on record. 
                Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around. 
                Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.</p><br>

            <h2>Loss of species</h2> <br>
            <p>Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. 
                These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires, extreme weather, 
                and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats. 
                Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.</p><br>

            <h2>Not enough food</h2> <br>
            <p>Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition. 
                Fisheries, crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less productive. 
                Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.</p><br>

        <h1 style="color: yellow;">CAUSES</h1>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Generating power</h2> <br>
            <p>Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and 
                natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. 
                Most of the electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; 
                only about a quarter comes from wind, solar, and other renewable sources.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Manufacturing goods</h2> <br>
            <p>Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, 
                mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like 
                cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. 
                Mining and other industrial processes also release gases.</p><br>

            <h2>Cutting down forests</h2> <br>
            <p>Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, 
                causes emissions because when trees are cut, they release the carbon they have been storing. 
                Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</p><br>

            <h2>Using transportation</h2> <br>
            <p>Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. 
                That makes transportation a major contributor of greenhouse gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions. 
                Road vehicles account for the largest part, but emissions from ships and planes continue to grow.</p><br>

            <h2>Producing food</h2> <br>
            <p>Producing food requires energy to run farm equipment or fishing boats, usually with fossil fuels. 
                Growing crops can also cause emissions, like when using fertilisers and manure. 
                Cattle produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And emissions also come from packaging and distributing food.</p><br>

            <h2>Consuming too much</h2> <br>
            <p>Your home and use of power, how you move around, what you eat and how much you throw away - 
                all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. 
                So does the consumption of goods such as clothing, electronics, and plastics.</p><br>

            <h2>Switch to an electric vehicle
            </h2> <br>
            <p>If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the market.
                 Even if they still run on electricity produced from fossil fuels, 
                 electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petrol or
                  diesel-powered vehicles.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Change your home's source of energy</h2> <br>
            <p>CAsk your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal, or gas. 
                If possible, see if you can switch to renewable sources such as wind or solar. 
                Or install solar panels on your roof to generate energy for your home.</p><br>

            <h2>Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle</h2> <br>
            <p>Electronics, clothes, and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, 
                from the extraction of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. 
                To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can, and recycle.</p><br>

            <h2>Walk, cycle, or take public transport
            </h2> <br>
            <p>The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or petrol. 
                Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions – 
                and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. 
                And carpool whenever possible.</p><br>

            <h2>Eat more vegetables</h2> <br>
            <p>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, 
                can significantly lower your environmental impact. 
                Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less 
                energy, land, and water.</p><br>

            <h2>Throw away less food</h2> <br>
            <p>When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to 
                grow, produce, package, and transport it. And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. 
                So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.</p><br>
