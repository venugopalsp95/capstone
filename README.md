## Overview

 This is a informative website about climate change and with that user can provide their opinion and participate in poll.

### Indistinct

 This website is completly different from the previous projects(mail and network), as in this website we are not
 making API calls to send and receive emails and we are not making any posts.


## My process

- I started to build this website after learning few things about Climate change first, later I planned the number of pages this website can have.
- Using box model I build the layout and made it mobile resposive   
- Then planned the layout of the home page by providing information about climate change.
- Then created a form for getting the opinion from the user.
- Then created a poll, so the user can participate in it.  

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Python
- Javascript
- [Styled Components](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) - For styles

### Distinctiveness

 In this website I tried to bring all the necessary basic information about climate change and giving the user a chance to give their opinion about what they think about climate change and they can even vote for what they are thinking about climate change. so this can be different from other websites, and can be a change in taking necessary actions on climate change. 

### Complexity

- While developing the website I felt difficult using some of the CSS properties, like display property, padding, margin. I tried to build navigation bar without using bootstrap so that i can learn some more properties of CSS.
- While working on poll section, It was complex so I worked on different approach and at the end I got what i required.
- And of course as a bigginer i had lot of syntax mistakes.

### What I learned

- By developing this website, first of all i learned something about climate change.
- I learned how to use CSS properties like display, flex, padding and more.
- I learned how to build a mobile-responsive website.
- I learned how to make a voting website by using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
